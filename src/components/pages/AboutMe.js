                    I'm a puzzle-solver at heart. Every job or hobby I've ever had has always drawn me in by giving me a puzzle to solve, and coding is no different! I love
                    taking all of the skills I've learned and applying them to solve each new task I'm presented with. I love a good challenge and am always up to learn more.
